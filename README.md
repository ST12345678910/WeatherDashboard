# WeatherDashboard
A simple weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API,
to retrieve weather data and make it available to the user. Once
the user has entered a search term, then they are given todays
weather info for that city, along with a five day forecast. Each
search is saved to `localStorage` and they are all viewable on the
side of the page.
